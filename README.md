## shr.me
An URL shortening website, written entirely in Go using the std/http package and pure HTML/CSS/JS

### Features
- Sign-up
- Sign-in
- Manage your registered URLs
- Basic security (hashed passwords, ~poor~ authority checking, SQL-injection proof ~maybe~)
- Of course can redirect the shortened URLs ~DUH~

### Warning
This project was my first time trying to build a website, apart from doing basic HTLM/CSS. The code is 
pretty much spaghetti, I didn't really make an effort to clean it up, but I guess it works ðŸ˜Ž.
